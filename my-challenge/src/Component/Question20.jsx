/*
Puzzle #20: Simpsons Quotes üç©
Write a React functional component that displays a card containing a
quote from The Simpsons. When the card is clicked, it should flip over to reveal
the character who said the quote and an image of the character. There should also 
be a button that, when clicked, fetches a new quote and displays it on the card.
