/*
Create a React app that allows users to generate a unique super hero name based
 on their birth month and day. The app should display a form with two dropdown
  menus for the user to select their birth month and day, and a "Submit" button. 
  When the user clicks the "Submit" button, the app should generate the super hero 
  name by combining a positive adjective from a list with a funny noun from another list,
   based on the selected birth month and day. The app should then display the super hero name to the user.
